# Covid-19 Spread Visualization and prediction by using Machine learning and deep learning
Project Proposal:-
The current destructive pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The 
outbreak has affected millions of people around the world and the number of infections and mortalities has been 
growing at an alarming rate. In such a situation, forecasting and proper study of the pattern of disease spread can 
inspire design better strategies to make more efficient decisions. Moreover, such studies play an important role 
in achieving accurate predictions.
Machine learning has numerous tools that can be used for visualization and prediction, and nowadays it 
is used worldwide for study of the pattern of COVID-19 spread, e.g. One of the main focus of the study in this 
project is to use machine learning techniques to analyze and visualize the spreading of the virus country-wise as 
well as globally during a specific period of time by considering confirmed cases, recovered cases and fatalities. 
The global impact of the outbreak on various aspects of life has been the focus of many studies, e.g. On the other 
hand, a pandemic can be forecast by considering a variety of parameters such as the impact of environmental 
factors, quarantine, age, gender and a lot more. The forecasting accuracy depends on the availability of proper 
data to base its predictions and provide an estimate of uncertainty. A challenge to use machine learning techniques 
for the current outbreak is that the datasets are not yet standardized by any standardization organization and the 
statistical anomalies are not considered. Also, the appropriate selection of parameters and the selection of the best 
machine learning model for prediction are other challenges involved in training a model. In this project, we are 
going to perform linear regression, Support vector machine, Multilayer perceptron, Ensemble methods, Time 
series with ARIMA and Prophet etc., on the Johns Hopkins Universityâ€™s COVID-19 data to anticipate the future 
effects of COVID-19 pandemic in India and some other countries. Moreover, we are going to study the impact of 
some parameters such as geographic conditions, economic statistics, population statistics, life expectancy, etc. in 
prediction of COVID-19 spread
